# Phase 0: Research & Unknowns Resolution

**Feature**: Advanced Scroll Animations for Portfolio  
**Date**: 2025-09-07  

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. GSAP ScrollTrigger Best Practices for Portfolio Sites

**Decision**: Use GSAP 3.13.0 with ScrollTrigger plugin via CDN  
**Rationale**: 
- Proven performance and browser compatibility
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Mature plugin ecosystem specifically for scroll-based animations
- No build tooling complexity for Astro integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Framer Motion: React-only, doesn't work with Astro
- AOS (Animate On Scroll): Limited customization, basic animations only
- CSS-only animations: Performance limitations, no scroll progress control
- Intersection Observer API: Would require custom animation engine

### 2. Performance Optimization Strategies for 60fps Scroll Animations

**Decision**: Implement GPU acceleration with transform-based animations  
**Rationale**:
- Transform and opacity properties bypass layout/paint phases
- `will-change` declarations prepare GPU layers in advance
- RequestAnimationFrame-based throttling prevents frame drops
- Mobile-specific optimizations for lower-powered devices

**Implementation approach**:
- Use `transform: translateY()` instead of changing `top`/`margin`
- Apply `will-change: transform` to animated elements
- Batch DOM reads/writes to minimize reflow
- Use GSAP's `force3D: true` for GPU layer promotion

### 3. Accessibility Compliance with Reduced Motion Preferences

**Decision**: Implement progressive enhancement with motion preferences  
**Rationale**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requires respecting user preferences
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` media query detection
- Graceful degradation maintains functionality without animations
- Maintains visual hierarchy through static positioning

**Implementation strategy**:
- Detect user preference at page load
- Disable ScrollTrigger animations if reduced motion preferred
- Apply immediate visibility changes instead of transitions
- Provide alternative visual cues (borders, shadows) for focus

### 4. Mobile Performance Optimization Patterns

**Decision**: Implement responsive animation complexity scaling  
**Rationale**:
- Mobile devices have limited CPU/GPU resources
- Touch scrolling has different momentum physics than desktop
- Network conditions affect GSAP CDN loading times
- Battery life considerations for continuous animations

**Scaling strategy**:
- Reduce animation quantity on viewport < 768px
- Simplify easing functions for mobile (linear vs. complex bezier)
- Implement intersection thresholds to reduce off-screen calculations
- Use CSS transforms exclusively (no layout-affecting properties)

### 5. Astro Static Site Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Client-side hydration with async GSAP loading  
**Rationale**:
- Astro's island architecture requires client-side animation initialization
- Static generation preserves SEO while enabling rich interactions
- CDN loading allows for better caching and performance
- No build-time dependencies keep deployment simple

**Integration approach**:
- Load GSAP asynchronously after page load
- Initialize animations in client:load components
- Preserve static content structure for SEO
- Handle loading states gracefully

## Technical Specifications Resolved

### Animation Timing and Easing
- **Entrance animations**: 0.6s duration, `power3.out` easing
- **Stagger delays**: 0.1s between elements, 0.2s between sections
- **Scroll progress**: Linear scrub for parallax, stepped for reveals
- **Mobile timing**: Reduced to 0.4s duration for faster perception

### Scroll Trigger Thresholds
- **Start threshold**: `"top 75%"` (element 25% visible)
- **End threshold**: `"bottom 25%"` (element mostly past viewport)
- **Refresh on resize**: Automatic ScrollTrigger.refresh() call
- **Batch processing**: Group nearby elements to reduce calculation overhead

### Performance Budgets
- **Initial load**: < 50kb additional JavaScript (GSAP + ScrollTrigger)
- **Runtime memory**: < 10MB additional heap usage
- **Animation frame rate**: Maintain 60fps during scroll
- **Mobile performance**: Degrade gracefully on slower devices

## Dependencies Confirmed

### Core Libraries
- **GSAP**: v3.13.0 (base animation engine)
- **ScrollTrigger**: v3.13.0 (scroll-based triggers)
- **CDN Source**: unpkg.com (reliable, global CDN)

### Development Tools
- **Playwright**: Visual regression testing for animations
- **Lighthouse**: Performance monitoring and budgets
- **Axe**: Accessibility compliance validation
- **Browser DevTools**: Timeline profiling for 60fps validation

### Browser Support Matrix
- **Minimum**: Chrome 60+, Firefox 60+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **Optimal**: Modern evergreen browsers (2022+)
- **Fallback**: Static content with CSS-only enhancements
- **Testing**: BrowserStack for cross-browser validation

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Loading Failures
- Graceful degradation when GSAP fails to load
- Timeout-based fallback after 3 seconds
- Local CDN fallback if primary source fails
- Content remains accessible without JavaScript

### Performance Degradation
- Automatic animation disabling on low-end devices
- Frame rate monitoring with performance.now() timestamps
- Progressive enhancement based on device capabilities
- Battery level consideration for mobile devices

### Accessibility Violations
- Comprehensive reduced motion support
- Keyboard navigation preservation during animations
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Focus management during animated transitions
