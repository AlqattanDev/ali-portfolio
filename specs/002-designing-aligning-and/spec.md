# Feature Specification: Advanced Scroll Animations for Portfolio

**Feature Branch**: `002-designing-aligning-and`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "designing, aligning and creating a similar scroll animations to our portfolio from @gsap-example/"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Create scroll-triggered animations for portfolio sections
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Portfolio visitors, content viewers
   ‚Üí Actions: Scrolling, viewing content, experiencing smooth animations
   ‚Üí Data: Portfolio sections (projects, skills, education, contact)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Performance, accessibility, mobile compatibility
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined based on GSAP examples analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Visit portfolio ‚Üí scroll through sections ‚Üí experience animations
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on animation triggers and behaviors
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Portfolio sections, animation states, scroll positions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focuses on user experience, not implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users experience and WHY animations enhance usability
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no GSAP specifics, code structure, or technical details)
- üë• Written for stakeholders who want to understand the enhanced user experience

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a portfolio visitor, I want to experience smooth, engaging animations as I scroll through the content so that I feel immersed in the professional presentation and have a memorable experience that reflects the developer's attention to detail and modern web development skills.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the portfolio page, **When** they scroll down, **Then** content sections appear with smooth fade-in and slide-up animations that feel natural and enhance readability
2. **Given** a user is viewing the projects section, **When** they scroll through project entries, **Then** each project card animates into view with staggered timing to create visual hierarchy
3. **Given** a user scrolls to the skills section, **When** the skills become visible, **Then** skill bars or elements animate to show progression and proficiency levels
4. **Given** a user scrolls quickly or slowly, **When** they change scroll speed, **Then** animations adapt gracefully without jarring interruptions or performance issues
5. **Given** a user scrolls back up, **When** they reverse direction, **Then** animations respond appropriately with reverse or fade-out effects where sensible

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user scrolls very rapidly through multiple sections?
- How does system handle animations on slower devices or reduced motion preferences?
- What occurs when user uses keyboard navigation or tab through content?
- How do animations behave on mobile devices with touch scrolling momentum?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST trigger smooth entrance animations when portfolio sections first become visible during scroll
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide staggered animations for multiple items (project cards, skill items) to create visual hierarchy
- **FR-003**: System MUST respect user accessibility preferences for reduced motion and disable animations accordingly
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain smooth performance at 60fps across all supported devices and browsers
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide appropriate timing for animations that feels natural and doesn't impede content consumption
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure animations enhance readability rather than distract from content
- **FR-007**: System MUST adapt animation intensity and complexity based on device performance capabilities
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide fallback behavior for users with JavaScript disabled
- **FR-009**: System MUST trigger animations at appropriate scroll thresholds to feel responsive but not premature
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all content remains accessible and readable during animation transitions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Portfolio Sections**: Contact, Projects, Skills, Education sections that serve as animation trigger zones
- **Animation States**: Inactive (before scroll trigger), Active (animating), Complete (animation finished), Reversed (scroll back behavior)
- **Scroll Thresholds**: Specific viewport percentages or pixel values that determine when animations should trigger
- **Performance Context**: Device capabilities, user preferences, and browser support levels that influence animation complexity
