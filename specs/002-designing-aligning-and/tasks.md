# Tasks: Advanced Scroll Animations for Portfolio

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-designing-aligning-and/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Tech stack: Astro 4.0, GSAP 3.13.0, ScrollTrigger plugin
   → Structure: Single project with client-side animations
2. Load design documents: ✓
   → data-model.md: Animation entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: API specifications → contract test tasks
   → research.md: GSAP decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: GSAP dependencies, performance monitoring
   → Tests: animation contracts, scroll behavior tests
   → Core: animation controller, scroll triggers
   → Integration: performance metrics, accessibility
   → Polish: visual tests, cross-browser validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different sections = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same Layout.astro = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness: All contracts tested ✓
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files/sections, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Single project structure:
- **Main files**: `src/layouts/Layout.astro`, `src/components/`
- **Tests**: `tests/contract/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/visual/`
- **Specs**: `specs/002-designing-aligning-and/`

## Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies
- T001 (GSAP setup) blocks T016-T018 (controller implementation)
- T016-T018 (core system) blocks T019-T022 (section animations)
- T019-T022 (animations) blocks T026-T029 (performance integration)
- All tests (T005-T015) must complete and fail before implementation (T016+)

### Parallel Groups
- **Setup**: T002-T004 can run together (different files)
- **Contract Tests**: T005-T008 can run together (different test files)
- **Integration Tests**: T009-T012 can run together (different sections)
- **Visual Tests**: T013-T015 can run together (independent validation)
- **Section Animations**: T019-T022 can run together (different DOM targets)
- **Polish**: T033-T035, T037-T038 can run together (different files)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Contract Tests Phase
```bash
# Launch T005-T008 together:
Task: "Contract test for ScrollAnimationController API in tests/contract/animation-api.test.js"
Task: "Contract test for scroll trigger thresholds in tests/contract/scroll-behavior.test.js" 
Task: "Contract test for performance metrics interface in tests/contract/performance-metrics.test.js"
Task: "Contract test for accessibility compliance in tests/contract/accessibility.test.js"
```

### Section Animation Implementation  
```bash
# Launch T019-T022 together (after core system ready):
Task: "Implement contact section fade-in animation targeting .execute-protocol"
Task: "Implement projects stagger animation targeting .project-entry elements"
Task: "Implement skills slide-up animation targeting .skill-category elements"  
Task: "Implement education fade-in animation targeting .education-entry elements"
```

### Polish & Validation
```bash
# Launch T033-T035 together:
Task: "Add unit tests for animation configuration validation in tests/unit/animation-config.test.js"
Task: "Create mobile responsiveness test in tests/integration/mobile-responsive.test.js"
Task: "Add keyboard navigation preservation test in tests/accessibility/keyboard-nav.test.js"
```

## Validation & Success Criteria

### Contract Compliance
- [ ] All animation-api.md interfaces implemented and tested
- [ ] All scroll-behavior.md trigger specifications validated
- [ ] Performance metrics contract satisfied (60fps, <200ms response)
- [ ] Accessibility contract compliance (reduced motion, keyboard nav)

### Implementation Completeness
- [ ] All 4 portfolio sections have scroll animations
- [ ] GSAP loading with fallback error handling works
- [ ] Mobile performance optimizations active
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

### Test Coverage
- [ ] All animation contracts have failing tests before implementation
- [ ] Visual regression tests capture animation sequences
- [ ] Performance tests validate 60fps requirement
- [ ] Accessibility tests confirm compliance

## Critical Success Factors

1. **TDD Compliance**: Tests T005-T015 MUST fail before any implementation begins
2. **Performance Target**: Maintain 60fps during scroll on all supported devices
3. **Accessibility**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion and maintain keyboard navigation
4. **Browser Support**: Work correctly in Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Static content remains functional if animations fail
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Reduced complexity and faster timing on mobile devices

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files/sections, no dependencies between them
- Verify all tests fail before implementing (red-green-refactor cycle)
- Commit after each completed task for progress tracking
- Animation timing based on research.md findings (0.6s duration, power3.out easing)
- ScrollTrigger thresholds per contracts/scroll-behavior.md specifications
