## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a potential employer, client, or collaborator visiting Ali AlQattan's portfolio, I want to experience a visually compelling, professionally designed website that effectively showcases his skills and projects, so that I can quickly assess his capabilities and be impressed by his attention to detail and design sensibilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor arrives at the portfolio homepage, **When** they view the site for the first time, **Then** they should immediately understand this is a professional developer's portfolio with clear visual hierarchy and modern design aesthetics
2. **Given** a visitor is browsing on any device, **When** they interact with the portfolio, **Then** the layout should adapt seamlessly and maintain readability and usability across different screen sizes
3. **Given** a recruiter is scanning the portfolio quickly, **When** they look at the projects and skills sections, **Then** key information should be immediately visible with clear visual emphasis on important achievements
4. **Given** a visitor wants to print or save the portfolio, **When** they switch to print mode, **Then** the design should transform into a clean, professional format suitable for physical or PDF sharing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when content overflows on smaller screens?
- How does the design handle very long project descriptions or skill names?
- How does the site perform and look on older browsers or slower connections?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Portfolio MUST present a visually cohesive design system with consistent typography, spacing, and color usage throughout all sections
- **FR-002**: Layout MUST adapt responsively to provide optimal viewing experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **FR-003**: Visual hierarchy MUST clearly distinguish between different content types (headers, body text, metadata, links) through typography and spacing
- **FR-004**: Interactive elements MUST provide clear visual feedback on hover, focus, and active states
- **FR-005**: Portfolio MUST load and render efficiently with optimized assets and smooth transitions
- **FR-006**: Design MUST enhance readability and scannability of technical content for professional audiences
- **FR-007**: Print mode MUST provide a clean, professional layout optimized for physical or PDF distribution
- **FR-008**: Color scheme and contrast MUST meet accessibility standards for professional use
- **FR-009**: Navigation and content organization MUST follow intuitive patterns that guide visitors through the portfolio logically
- **FR-010**: Visual elements MUST reinforce Ali's personal brand as a systems architect with technical expertise

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific design style preferences - minimalist, modern, creative, corporate?]
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Target audience priorities - technical recruiters, startup founders, enterprise clients?]
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance targets for loading time and rendering?]
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Browser support requirements?]
