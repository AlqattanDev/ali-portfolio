# Implementation Plan: Portfolio Design Enhancement

**Branch**: `001-enhancing-the-overall` | **Date**: 2025-09-06 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-enhancing-the-overall/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enhance the visual design, layout, and styling of Ali AlQattan's portfolio website to create a professionally compelling, modern interface that effectively showcases skills and projects for potential employers and clients. Focus on visual hierarchy, responsive design, accessibility, and brand consistency while optimizing for both digital and print modes.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript (Astro framework)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Astro 4.x, CSS-in-JS (embedded styles)  
**Storage**: N/A (static site)  
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (visual regression, accessibility testing)  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (modern), mobile responsive, print-optimized  
**Project Type**: web (static site with frontend focus)  
**Performance Goals**: <3s load time, 95+ Lighthouse score, smooth animations  
**Constraints**: GitHub Pages deployment, no backend required, accessibility compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page portfolio, ~10 sections, responsive breakpoints

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (static portfolio site - no separation needed)
- Using framework directly? Yes (Astro with embedded CSS, no wrapper abstractions)
- Single data model? Yes (profile.json contains all data)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (no over-engineered design systems, direct styling)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A (UI enhancement, not functional libraries)
- Libraries listed: N/A (styling and design improvements)
- CLI per library: N/A (no libraries being created)
- Library docs: N/A (visual design feature)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Will apply to visual regression tests
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Will establish visual baselines first
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Adapted for UI: Baseline→Visual→Accessibility→Unit
- Real dependencies used? Yes (actual browsers, real screen sizes)
- Integration tests for: Visual regression, cross-browser compatibility, responsive layouts
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before baseline establishment

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? N/A (static site)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (no backend)
- Error context sufficient? Will ensure graceful degradation

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.1.0 (minor design enhancement)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? Will maintain backward compatibility

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - This is a static portfolio site enhancement, not a full web application requiring frontend/backend separation.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Tasks Identified**:
1. Modern portfolio design trends 2024-2025
2. CSS Grid and Flexbox best practices for portfolio layouts
3. Typography systems for developer portfolios
4. Color theory and professional color schemes
5. Accessibility standards for portfolio websites
6. Visual hierarchy techniques for technical content
7. Responsive design breakpoints and mobile-first approaches
8. Print CSS optimization strategies
9. Animation and micro-interaction best practices
10. Performance optimization for design-heavy sites

**Dispatching research for unknowns in Technical Context**:
- Visual regression testing tools and setup
- Accessibility testing automation
- Design system establishment for consistency

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

**Design Artifacts to Generate**:
1. **Visual Design System** (`data-model.md`):
   - Color palette specification
   - Typography scale and hierarchy
   - Spacing system
   - Component design tokens
   - Responsive breakpoint definitions

2. **Component Contracts** (`contracts/`):
   - Visual regression test specifications
   - Accessibility test contracts
   - Performance benchmark contracts
   - Cross-browser compatibility requirements

3. **Design Implementation Tests**:
   - Visual baseline establishment (before/after screenshots)
   - Accessibility audit checklist
   - Performance metric thresholds
   - Mobile responsiveness validation

4. **User Experience Validation** (`quickstart.md`):
   - Design review checklist
   - User journey validation steps
   - Cross-device testing protocol

5. **Agent Context Update**:
   - Update Claude Code context with design system patterns
   - Include component styling guidelines
   - Add accessibility requirements

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate design implementation tasks from visual system requirements
- Each component redesign → visual baseline + implementation + validation task
- Each responsive breakpoint → mobile testing task
- Each accessibility requirement → a11y audit task
- Performance optimization tasks based on Lighthouse metrics

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Design-first order: Research → Design System → Components → Testing
- Dependency order: Base styles → Layout → Components → Interactions
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent component styling)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered design and development tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Design implementation (execute styling and layout tasks)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (visual regression tests, accessibility audit, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - design enhancement fits within simplicity constraints*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
